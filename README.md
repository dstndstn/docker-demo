# docker-demo

An example github repo referenced in my "Docker for Research
Computing" talk.

In the "docker" directory is an example Dockerfile that goes with the
"amazing.py" script.

In the "docker-mpi" directory is a Dockerfile that uses MPICH and
builds the Python mpi4py library to use multiple cores and multiple
nodes.  That goes with the "sampler.py" script.
